# Common experience sample

[日本語版README](https://github.com/open-video-game-library/CommonExperienceSample/blob/main/README.JP.md)


Common experience sample is an open experience sample for evaluating tactile displays. You can adjust and experience basic actions such as grasping, holding, and holding the display. For each of the six dimensional object characteristics (texture, hardness, temperature, weight, shape, and motion) that the tactile display provides feedback on, samples that are frequently used in existing research can be used. The common experience sample is intended to be a standard evaluation stimulus for tactile displays and to promote comparison between displays.

## Features



#### Parameter adjustment and output function
	
Various parameters that are in high demand for adjustment in the sample can be easily adjusted on the GUI. In addition, the adjusted parameter information can be exported and read to reflect the differences. This allows you to reflect the parameter information of other researchers and unify the experimental conditions.

abstract = {Many haptic displays that provide haptic feedback to users have been proposed;however, differences in experimental environments make comparisons of displays difficult. Therefore, we categorized the characteristics of feedback based on existing research, and developed a common experience sample that includes virtual objects necessary for the expression of each characteristic. Additionally, we will study the methods of evaluating displays using the proposed sample, and aim at comparative evaluation of multiple displays.},

## Note

-  Please refrain from publishing any material downloaded from the common experience sample under the false pretense that it was developed by you.

-  We are not responsible for any trouble/damage caused by the use of the common experience sample.

-  The content and terms of use of the Common Experience Samples are subject to change without notice.

-  The Common Experience sample allows you to change the parameters in the game, but please be sure to clearly state the values of the parameters you set in order to keep the study fair and reproducible.
