abstract = {Many haptic displays that provide haptic feedback to users have been proposed;however, differences in experimental environments make comparisons of displays difficult. Therefore, we categorized the characteristics of feedback based on existing research, and developed a common experience sample that includes virtual objects necessary for the expression of each characteristic. Additionally, we will study the methods of evaluating displays using the proposed sample, and aim at comparative evaluation of multiple displays.},
